# Important
In its current state, you shouldn't use this. It was a proof of concept for making a GUI to handle event editing.  
At the time I was proud of it, but it messes with timing and sound effects of edited events so it's not really usable.
## Notable Features
- Open an event PAK or an extracted EVT file to view a timeline of commands and objects
- Edit event text on the fly when opening an event PAK that contains a BMD file
- Create a new EVT from scratch
- Add, delete, modify or reschedule commands
- Add, delete, or modify objects
